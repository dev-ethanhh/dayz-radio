### Setting up the bot
<hr>
To install this program, you just need <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a>.
Once the repository is installed, extract it.
You’ll need to edit the radio.py file, from lines 7 to 33, all instructions are provided there.

If you don’t have a code editor, I strongly recommend <a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a>, which is like VS Code but without Microsoft’s data collection.

Then, install the required library by running:
```sh
pip install discord
```
Finally, navigate to the repository folder in your terminal and run:
```sh
python radio.py
```

Your bot should run fine, but because I made this program a couple of years ago, it may not.
Try fixing it, should not be hard, if you can't, contact me by mail, it's in my profile
